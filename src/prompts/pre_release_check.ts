Steps:
1. Use \`popular\` to scan all key packages in this project's ecosystem for known vulnerabilities.
2. For any packages identified as critical to this project, use \`vulns\` to check for vulnerabilities.
3. Use \`inspect\` on the top 5 dependencies by importance to verify licenses are compatible and no advisories are outstanding.
4. Flag any HIGH or CRITICAL severity vulnerabilities as **release blockers**.
5. Flag any copyleft licenses (GPL, AGPL, LGPL) that may conflict with the project's MIT license as **license blockers**.

Output a release checklist:
- ✅ or ❌ Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL/HIGH)
- ✅ or ❌ License compatibility
- ✅ or ❌ No abandoned dependencies (last published >2 years ago)

End with a clear **SAFE TO RELEASE** or **BLOCKED — fix these issues first** verdict.`,
