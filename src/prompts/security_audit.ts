Follow these steps:
1. Use \`popular\` to check the most commonly used packages in this ecosystem for known vulnerabilities — this gives a quick baseline.
2. For any specific packages you can identify in the project, use \`vulns\` to check each one for CVEs and advisories.
3. Use \`inspect\` on the 3-5 most critical dependencies to check their licenses, OpenSSF Scorecard, and GitHub health.
4. For any package names that look unusual or unfamiliar, use \`typosquat\` to check for potential typosquatting.
5. If any vulnerabilities are found, use \`advisories\` to get full details and fix guidance.

Summarize findings as:
- **Critical / High** vulnerabilities that need immediate attention
- **License risks** (copyleft licenses, unknown licenses)
- **Health concerns** (abandoned packages, low Scorecard scores)
- **Recommended actions** with specific version upgrades where available`,
